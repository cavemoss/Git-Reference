git Branching —— idea of branching out lines of commits


git checkout <commit_hash>    # view a previous version (branching warning)

git reset --hard HEAD^              # delete previous commit
  git reset --hard HEAD~<number>    # delete multiple previous commits

git branch <branch_name>                    # create branch originating from the current branch
  git branch <branch_name> <commit_hash>    # brunch out of a certain commit
  git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>       # rename branch
  git branch -d <branch_name>               # delete branch

git checkout <commit_hash> <files>    # restore a previous version
  git checkout <commit_hash> .

git merge <branch_name>    # merge another brunch into the current brunch
